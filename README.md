# Basic-Portfolio
For this homework I tried the recommended version.
On portfolio.html I was able to align my image and text in a way that I liked, I wasn't however able to
place a box inside a box.

For index.html while I was able to place text infront of the image I can't quite align them the way I would like 
for them to be aligned.

Finally, on contact.html I was able to place a form where the user can input first and last name, but for some 
reason alignment is the most challeging aspect for me throughtout this project.
