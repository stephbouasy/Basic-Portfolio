        <p class="bio">My name is Stephanie Bouasy and I'm from Dallas, Texas. I studied and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Econmics and a minor in Business Administration from The University of Texas at Arlington. I like styuding about data analytics and working in programs such as Stata and Tableau. On my off time I enjoy knitting, reading, and spending time with my 4 year-old son, Jase. I don't have much experience with coding, but I'm learning as much as I can.  </p>
